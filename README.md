# Scripts for Adobe Indesign

Some scripts I've written to help use Adobe Indesign.

---

## Copy Things.js

This script is useful for copying/updating styles from one document to one or more open destination documents.

![The Copy Things script UI](docs/images/copy-things-ui-1.png)

1. Choose the thing type: *Character Styles, Paragraph Styles, Object Styles, Cell Styles, TableStyles, Swatches*.
1. Filter the list of things.
1. The list of things to copy.
1. The list of destination documents (all open documents).
1. Press this to do the copying.

### Features

- Quickly access and select multiple things to copy in one go.
- Copy to as many documents as you have open in one go.
- Will update existing things, if they already exists.
- Takes account of the hierarchic structure in the source document, and replicates it in the destination.

### Limitations

- Not much testing done! If you find a bug, please [start a new Issue](https://github.com/mark1bean/scripts-for-adobe-indesign/issues).
- The scripting API doesn't provide control over the *order* of the copied things, so you may need to sort them afterwards.
